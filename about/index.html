      <p class="light" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">I recently graduated from Dartmouth College, where I studied computer science with additional coursework in statistics and economics. I'm interested in combining my interests in finance and technology to work at the forefront of emerging technologies that will allow young and inexperienced investors to easily understand the financial risks and expected returns of their investments.</p>

      <p class="light" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">I enjoy science from both the empirical and sociological perspectives, and have pursued my interest in scientific education and outreach through Dartmouth's undergraduate scientific publication <a href="//dujs.dartmouth.edu" target="_blank">DUJS</a> and an initiative I co-founded called <a href="//dujs.dartmouth.edu/stem-guide" target="_blank">STEM @ Dartmouth</a>. You can read about these activities and others on my <a href="/interests/">Interests page.</a> I've also been part of a couple <a href="/projects/">software projects</a>, including a news aggregator/categorization engine called <a href="//www.sourcemash.com" target="_blank">Sourcemash</a> that won the 2015 Kemeny Computing Prize and was co-developed with fellow Dartmouth alum <a href="//www.alexgerstein.com" target="_blank">Alex Gerstein.</a></p>

      <p class="light" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">I've also authored and co-authored a couple papers with <a href="//dhedartmouth.org" target="_blank">Dartmouth Humanitarian Engineering</a> (<a href="//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705814010558" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187770581401056X" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705814010546" target="_blank">here</a>), graduated summa cum laude as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, spent a couple years as a <a href="//admissions.dartmouth.edu" target="_blank">Tour Guide</a> at Dartmouth and am always excited to <a href="mailto:scott.w.gladstone@gmail.com?subject=Dartmouth!">talk about my alma mater</a>, volunteer at an amazing NYC-based organization called <a href="//www.goddard.org/" target="_blank">Goddard Riverside Community Center</a>, and am currently pursuing my CFA as a Portfolio Risk analyst at <a href="//www.blackrock.com/" target="_blank">BlackRock.</a></p>

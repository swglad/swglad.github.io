              "There has been an amazing transformation around the sciences on campus, in our society, and around the world. In a few short decades, this country has moved from a workforce that was dominated by manufacturing to one that is dominated by technology. And this is not just in Silicon Valley: wall street, medicine, bio-tech, education, government, law enforcement, and beyond are all becoming more and more dominated and driven by science and technology. This has had a profound impact on our society and particularly on students that are looking down the road 5, 10, 20 years and wondering what the future will hold. This can be both a time of excitement and uncertainty.

              There is a sense among many today that a STEM -- Science, Technology, Engineering & Math -- degree is required in order to be competitive. I think that there is some truth to this. But, I don't think that this means that you should follow a career that does not excite you only because of a perceived external pressure. And I definitely don't think that you should simply abandon the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences -- I am a true believer in the liberal arts. I also believe that the liberal arts should encompass a broad and deep exposure to STEM. STEM majors are multifaceted and offer many many different opportunities that you may not be aware of."

              As President and Managing Editor of the <a href="//dujs.dartmouth.edu" target="_blank">Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science</a> from 2012-2015, I founded the <a href="//dujs.dartmouth.edu/stem-guide" target="_blank">STEM @ Dartmouth</a> initiative and led the inaugural publication of the <a href="//dujs.dartmouth.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015-STEM-Guide-downloadable.pdf" target="_blank">STEM Guide</a>, an educational resource about coursework, extracurricular and career opportunities available to undergraduates pursuing STEM degrees. I also spearheaded the <a href="//dujs.dartmouth.edu/isec-2015" target="_blank">International Science Essay Competition (ISEC)</a>, an effort aimed at reaching out to high school studnets around the world and introducing them to the resources available to science-interested students by government agencies, scholarship foundations, and Dartmouth College.

              Some of my personal favorites are Isaac Asimov's short stories "Nightfall" and "The Last Question". I've also read, watched and enjoyed other works by Asimov, Clarke, Adams, Herbert, Vonnegut, and others.

            <p class="light">Founded in 1998, the <a href="//dujs.dartmouth.edu" target="_blank">Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science</a> aims to increase scientific awareness by providing an interdisciplinary forum for sharing undergraduate research and enriching scientific knowledge. The DUJS prints quarterly journals that include science news and review articles, along with research by undergraduates. The organization actively pursues an international STEM outreach effort to educate and inform high school students and undergraduates about opportunities for individuals with STEM degrees.
            <br><br>
            It was an honor to have served as the organization's President and Managing Editor from 2012-2015, and I continue to be impressed with DUJS' strong commitment to integrity, education, and collaboration within the undergraduate and global scientific community.

Goddard's mission is to "meet people's basic needs -- food, shelter, education -- and to bring them together for mutual aid, social action, and to celebrate our richness as a society."
            <br><br>
            Since 2007, each Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, my family and I (and a couple hundred other volunteers) have worked with Goddard to host and serve a free, warm, home-cooked, sit-down holiday dinner. Volunteers help to prepare and serve over 3000 meals that are both given to visitors and delivered to home-bound locals who cannot attend the dinner. According to Goddard, "Guests include people in need, homeless adults, elderly individuals and families. The dinners have been a neighborhood tradition for more than 40 years."
